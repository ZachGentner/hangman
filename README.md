A working multiplayer hangman game. Functionality must be added to prevent players from entering
a phrase that contains invalid characters. Methods must also detect both uppercase and lowercase
versions of the letters that a player guesses. Players should not be penalized for guessing an
incorrect letter that has already been guessed.
